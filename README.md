# This project demonstrates how to use Python to build a Twitter sentiment analysis model. To determine how people feel about particular topics, Twitter sentiment analysis is used. In this experiment, we will examine how people feel about Pfizer vaccinations. To build this machine learning model, we'll use the data that's accessible on Kaggle. To identify the various sentiments present in the gathered tweets from Twitter, machine learning will be used to analyse the tweets. Positive, negative, and neutral sentiments are among the several emotions that this investigation identified. Additionally, we'll test various classifiers to discover which one provides the best model accuracy. 

# It sets up an SQLite database with usernames and hashed passwords for storing user data. Users can register by entering their username and password on the signup page. Before being stored in the database, the password is securely hashed. Users can log in using their credentials on the login page. The code checks to see if the hashed password in the database matches the password that was entered. Display Messages: The results of sign-up and login attempts are used to determine whether success or error messages are displayed. As needed, the database connection is opened and terminated. As per the dataset, list down the top influencers list which were clean and apply analysis part and integrated to the website to show the top followers. Then, the interactive dashboard showcases the trends and patterns amongst the available dataset in some graphs, charts, and other graphical instances. At the end, a list of trending themes which means debets, retweets and popular topics listed on a websites.
